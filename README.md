This is a simple script to create a sqlite emojis.db to be bundled in the Fernschreiber Telegram client.

It mostly recreates the Database format originally created by an internal tool for older versions of Fernschreiber.

# Usage:

 - clone this repo, cd into it
 - run npm i
 - edit the config.json5 (you may want to fill in an up to date emoji-test url)
 - run npm start
